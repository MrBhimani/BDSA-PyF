This project consists of the study of Bird strike or collision eradication system in aviation or Airports. Currently, Most of the Airports are using old technology for the removal of bird from the airport like air canon gun, Laser, etc. Now, here we
implemented new advanced technology using Machine Learning which detects bird automatically and removes by itself. I used Raspberry Pi controller which active the output devices and entry of restrict bird from different-different directions. As part of this project main detection part is completed. Now working on multiple speciec with flock of bird removal.
